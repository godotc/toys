# toys (ignore me)



A repository for myself to stash temp files or synchronization in multiple places. This repo contains many codes in multiple program langs.

You can ignore this repo in most of the time. Because most of files here were just for testing,  or of practice's demo script, about what I leaned.
And the structure/directries were not  organizaed with rules that could make sense.

Maybe some test demos, that I just settup it once, then just forgget to continue coding. And didn not to know when to fill the holes. So there are a bunch of semi-finish brainfxxks.

But if you rummage through it...
Maybe you could find serval funny things that could be considered as some useful sample or some meaningful testings that made by me.~~
